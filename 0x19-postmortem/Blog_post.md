Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on January 21, 2024
Issue Summary:
Duration: January 21, 2024, 10:15 AM - 1:30 PM (UTC)
Impact: Users experienced a complete service outage, affecting 25% of our user base.
Affected Service: The primary web application, resulting in unavailability and slow response times.
Timeline:
10:15 AM: Issue detected by automated monitoring systems.
10:20 AM: Initial investigation by the operations team.
10:30 AM: Assumed a database overload due to increased traffic; database scaling initiated.
11:00 AM: No improvement observed; frontend and backend systems inspected for potential bottlenecks.
11:45 AM: Misleading path - suspected a DDoS attack; network configurations examined.
12:15 PM: Escalated incident to senior DevOps and Database teams.
12:30 PM: Root cause identified as a misconfigured load balancer causing traffic diversion.
1:00 PM: Load balancer reconfiguration initiated.
1:30 PM: Service fully restored; monitoring systems verified normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was traced to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. The load balancer was inadvertently routing traffic to an outdated server instance, causing service degradation. The resolution involved reconfiguring the load balancer to ensure proper distribution of incoming requests to healthy server instances.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Load Balancer Configuration Review: Implement a regular review process for load balancer configurations to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Automated Health Checks: Enhance automated health checks on server instances to promptly identify discrepancies and prevent the diversion of traffic to unhealthy instances.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Load Balancer Configuration Audit: Conduct a comprehensive audit of all load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any discrepancies.
Automated Testing for Configuration Changes: Implement automated testing procedures to validate the impact of load balancer configuration changes before deployment.
Incident Response Training: Conduct additional training for operations and DevOps teams to enhance incident response capabilities and quick identification of root causes.
Enhanced Monitoring: Integrate additional monitoring metrics to detect misconfigurations or anomalies in real-time.
Conclusion:
The outage on January 21, 2024, was a result of a misconfigured load balancer, causing service unavailability for approximately three hours. The incident was promptly addressed, and corrective measures have been outlined to prevent similar issues in the future. The implementation of improved monitoring, regular configuration audits, and automated testing will contribute to a more resilient and reliable web stack.
